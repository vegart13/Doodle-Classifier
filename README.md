# DoodleClassifier UiA

This project was done by 3 Students from UiA to learn about Machine Learning and to try to create a DoodleClassifier that would identify "Doodles" that were being drawn. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

<p>What things you need to install the software and how to install them<br>
Code Editor(Visual Studio/ATOM was used by us)<br>
Data from https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data<br>
Node.js<br>
P5 Library<br>
Processing
<br>
</p>

### Installing
Download and install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Processing](https://processing.org/) if you want to process the data yourself.<br>
A tutorial on how to prepare your own data with Processing can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7U6WA7Ffk)<br>
The program runs on the browser using the P5 Library for Javascript, after installing Node run the command:<br>
`npm install -g browser-sync`<br>
Then cd into the project folder and run command: <br>
`browser-sync start --server -f -w`<br>
Then head in to localhost:3000 and open the console on your browser to see the model be trained for 5 epochs, and when it's done you can try to draw yourself in the canvas.
