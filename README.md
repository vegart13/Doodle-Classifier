# DoodleClassifier

[About]
----------
This is an introductory project developed by Daniel Shiffman on his youtube channel "The Coding Train". The purpose of this project is to get more familiar with machine learning through a relatively small scale project. It uses the "Quick, Draw!" dataset from Google Creative Labs, a collection of 50 million drawings across 345 categories all gathered through a service that collects user drawings and tags them with the appropriate metadata (https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/).
